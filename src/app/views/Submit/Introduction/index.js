				<Figure src="images/poster.jpg" feature>"This is not a pipe" is a famous play on reality by Ren√© Magritte. He was trying to say that the image he drew and most would refer to as a "pipe" isn't. It's just a drawing or a collection of color pigments on a piece of paper. Can't smoke that.</Figure>

				<SectionTitle>Topics & Submission Types</SectionTitle>
				<p>You can write or photograph pretty much anything you like, as long as it&rsquo;s not offensive or stolen. NSFW submissions aren&rsquo;t accepted (yet).</p>
				<p>Submission types typically accepted:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Just the photo</strong> &mdash; one image, a title and perhaps a caption for the photo.</li>
					<li><strong>Photo essay</strong> &mdash; you can have one image with a story, or a few images that make up a story. Your story could be a written word or you could tell it with images only.</li>
					<li><strong>Article</strong> &mdash; while photo essays are considered <em>storytelling through art</em>, articles could be technical, newsworthy or simply fun to read anecdoes.</li>
					<li><strong>Beyond the grain</strong> &mdash; Analog.Cafe focuses on film photography as creative medium. &ldquo;Beyond the grain&rdquo; is <em>everything but film photography</em> that&rsquo;s related to art, creativity or something the editor may find fitting here.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<Quote cite="Analog.Cafe">The <strong>collaborative publication platform</strong> for the film photography community. Anyone can submit images, photo essays and articles through the beautiful, easy to use web app. No more complicated, ugly forms.</Quote>
