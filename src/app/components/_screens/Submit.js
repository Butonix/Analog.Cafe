        <h3>How to submit.</h3>
        <p>
          It&rsquo;s very easy to use the <strong>Analog.Cafe Composer</strong>.
          You can insert your images and edit text with ease. The Composer tool
          will do all the formatting and beautification for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Image Suggestions</strong> &mdash; when you upload your
          images, you will see <em>Image Suggestions:</em> hand-picked
          photographs that you can use freely in your submission.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can choose whether you want your photographs to be considered for
          Image Suggestions or not when you see “More Exposure?” question upon
          sending your submission.
        </p>

        <h3>How to get accepted.</h3>
        <p>
          Analog.Cafe focuses heavily on film photography as the subject of
          every submission. That being said, if your work suits the general
          style of the publication but doesn&rsquo;t use photographs shot on
          film it can still be accepted.
        </p>
        <p>Here is a list of formats submissions are typically accepted in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>A Photo</strong> &mdash; one image, a title and perhaps a
            caption for the photograph.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A Photo Essay</strong> &mdash; you can have one image with a
            story or a few images that make up a narrative.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>An Opinion/Article</strong> &mdash; your thoughts, advice,
            and opinions on film photography and art in general.{" "}
            <em>
              Please see <Link to="/articles">Articles</Link> section for
              examples of appropriate submissions.
            </em>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For images, JPG and PNG formats are accepted, maximum 5MB per file.
          Please make sure the quality is good enough to display on large
          screens.
        </p>
