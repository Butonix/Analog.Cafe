				<h3>How to submit.</h3>
				<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to use the <strong>Analog.Cafe Composer</strong>. You can insert your images and edit text with ease. The Composer tool will do all the formatting and beautification for you.</p>
				<Figure src="/images/pictures/submit.gif" nocaption></Figure>
				<p><strong>Image Suggestions</strong> &mdash; when you upload your images, you will see <em>Image Suggestions</em>. They are hand-picked selections by the editor that you can use freely. A credit to the original photographer will appear automatically.</p>
				<p>You will also have a choice to participate or opt out from the Image Suggestions program.</p>

				<h3>How to get accepted.</h3>
				<p>Analog.Cafe focuses heavily on film photography as the subject of every submission. That being said, if your work suits the general style of the publication but doesn&rsquo;t use photographs shot on film it can still be accepted.</p>
				<p>Here is a list of formats submissions are typically accepted in:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>A Photo</strong> &mdash; one image, a title and perhaps a caption for the photograph.</li>
					<li><strong>A Photo Essay</strong> &mdash; you can have one image with a story or a few images that make up a narrative.</li>
					<li><strong>An Opinion/Article</strong> &mdash; your thoughts, advice, and opinions on film photography and art in general.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>For images, JPG and PNG formats are accepted, maximum 5MB per file. Please make sure the quality is good enough to display on large screens.</p>
