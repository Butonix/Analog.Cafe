				<blockquote><strong>Analog.Cafe</strong> exists because of the people who contribute their art and the editors who curate it. Because of the developers and designers who contribute their time and skill to build this platform. And because of the 51 people who have graciously <Link to="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dmitrizzle/analogcafe-the-remarkable-film-photography-blog">funded</Link> the initial stages of this project.</blockquote>
				<p><strong>Analog.Cafe</strong> is a curated film photography publication that encourages and supports collaboration.</p>
