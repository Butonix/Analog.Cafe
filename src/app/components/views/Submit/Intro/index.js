				<p><strong>Image Suggestions</strong> &mdash; when you upload your images, you will see <em>Image Suggestions</em>. They are hand-picked selections by the editor that you can freely use here on Analog.Cafe website. A credit to the original photographer will appear automatically.</p>
				<p>You will also have a chance to participate or opt out from the <em>Image Suggestions</em> program.</p>

				<h3>How to Get Accepted</h3>

				<p>Analog.Cafe focuses heavily on film photography as the subject of every submission. That being said, if your work suits the general style of the publication but doesn&rsquo;t use photographs shot on film it can still be accepted.</p>

				<p>Here is a list of formats submissions are typically accepted in:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>A Photo</strong> &mdash; one image, a title and perhaps a caption for the photograph.</li>
					<li><strong>Photo Essay</strong> &mdash; you can have one image with text or a few images that make up a story.</li>
					<li><strong>Opinion/Article</strong> &mdash; your thoughts, advice, and opinions on film photography and art in general.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>For images, JPG and PNG formats are accepted, maximum 5MB per file. Please make sure the quality is good enough to display on large screens.</p>
