The photograph is not the tractor. A photograph is not the thing it depicts. A photograph is a piece of art created by sifting physical reality through the creative tendencies of a human being and some amount of physical process depending on the medium. The question of whether photography is art will last forever. My own opinion is “it can be”.

I choose to see it as representative of the fractured nature of reality based on perception and angle of view. One of my favourite quotes from “The Matrix” is “Eventually you come to realise that it is not the spoon that bends, it is yourself.” We create our own reality by will or by accident and my reality naturally influences how I interpret art and how I form my own photographs.","marks":[]}]}]},{"data":{},"kind":"block","isVoid":false,"type":"heading","nodes":[{"kind":"text","ranges":[{"kind":"range","text":"Levers.","marks":[]}]}]},{"data":{"caption":"“Levers” – shot on Ilford FP4+ with Mamiya RB67 and 90mm Sekor lens.","src":"/images/pictures/robert-levers.jpg","feature":true},"kind":"block","isVoid":true,"type":"image","nodes":[{"kind":"text","ranges":[{"kind":"range","text":" ","marks":[]}]}]},{"data":{},"kind":"block","isVoid":false,"type":"paragraph","nodes":[{"kind":"text","ranges":[{"kind":"range","text":"Our farming heritage is important. Without the move from Hunter-Gatherer to Farmer, we would not have society as it exists today. Whilst some could argue that would be a good thing, it would certainly be a very different world. One of the next great leaps forward was the mechanisation of farming. Levers played a major part in the control of this process, and indeed levers are a wonderful metaphor for the transition of our species away from the earth and towards their own destiny. Truly Humankind generally believes that they are separate from the earth and able to exist without considering it. Workers of the land know differently, our future and that of the land are inextricably joined and levers that act upon it also act upon ourselves.","marks":[]}]}]},{"data":{},"kind":"block","isVoid":false,"type":"heading","nodes":[{"kind":"text","ranges":[{"kind":"range","text":"Bars.","marks":[]}]}]},{"data":{"caption":"“Bars” – shot on Ilford FP4+ with Mamiya RB67 and 90mm Sekor lens.","src":"/images/pictures/robert-bars.jpg","feature":true},"kind":"block","isVoid":true,"type":"image","nodes":[{"kind":"text","ranges":[{"kind":"range","text":" ","marks":[]}]}]},{"data":{},"kind":"block","isVoid":false,"type":"paragraph","nodes":[{"kind":"text","ranges":[{"kind":"range","text":"Life places many bars in our way.
