Today it is still used by millions of artists and hobbyists who appreciate or feel fascinated by the process and the results. Analogue, when taken within the context of technology, means signals of a variable quantity. To make things a little simpler I will explain what analogue means for sound transmissions first, before moving on to a slightly more complex imaging technology. Let’s begin.",
