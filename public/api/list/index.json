    	"summary" : "Brighton Beach is a Russian community neighbourhood in New York. When I was growing up in Moscow as a kid I’ve heard a lot about it on TV: the magical place where one can become and live like an American. During the early 90s, there was an obsession with everything USA; it suddenly became “amazing and wonderful”, instead of “the villain” — a narrative it was given for over fifty years prior. Perestroika flipped the entire culture onto its head."

While the test run of the Canon Sure Shot AF-7 was mainly done in Chongqing, I tested the Olympus Supertrip once I’d got back to Shanghai."
