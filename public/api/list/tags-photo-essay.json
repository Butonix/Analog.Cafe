      "summary" : "In Thailand, school is out for at least two months around March-April. Unfortunately, that’s also when the burning season begins. An excellent time to make a run for it if you ask me. Especially when living in Chiang Mai. A small city of 300,000 surrounded by farming fields which get very smoky during those sizzling months. My wife, Betty, and I heard good things about Taiwan. That’s typically enough for us to buy tickets and fly to a place that’s on the same continent. Which we did."

Rob’s motivation while approaching his subject is philosophical. His prime interest is the emotions that arise in the photographer’s and the viewers’ minds."

I was in Toronto selling and tossing all of our numerous and useless belongings, while Betty was setting up camp in China and reconnecting with her family. This is when she took this photo."

When I was growing up in Moscow as a kid I’ve heard a lot about it on TV: the magical place where one can become and live like an American. During the early 90s, there was an obsession with everything USA; it suddenly became “amazing and wonderful”, instead of “the villain” — a narrative it was given for over fifty years prior. Perestroika flipped the entire culture onto its head."
