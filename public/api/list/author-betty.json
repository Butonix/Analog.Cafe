      "summary" : "In Thailand, school is out for at least two months around March-April. Unfortunately, that’s also when the burning season begins. An excellent time to make a run for it if you ask me. Especially when living in Chiang Mai. A small city of 300,000 surrounded by farming fields which get very smoky during those sizzling months. My wife, Betty, and I heard good things about Taiwan. That’s typically enough for us to buy tickets and fly to a place that’s on the same continent. Which we did."

I was in Toronto selling and tossing all of our numerous and useless belongings, while Betty was setting up camp in China and reconnecting with her family. This is when she took this photo."
