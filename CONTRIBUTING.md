## How do I contribute?
If you are interested in contributing to this project - awesome! Have a look at [issues](https://github.com/dmitrizzle/Analog.Cafe/issues) and submit a PR if you have a fix or create a new one if you notice a bug.

Have a look at [README.md](https://github.com/dmitrizzle/Analog.Cafe#how-do-i-contribute) for all the steps that you'll need to know in order to spin this project up on your machine. Please also visit [Wiki](https://github.com/dmitrizzle/Analog.Cafe/wiki) for release guide, design guide and more.

## Why should I contribute?
This is indeed another CMS, with a unique combination of features and build quality not found anywhere else. If you would like to help build software that makes publishing simple, with a single, clear purpose, that works fast and looks great out of the box - this is a good place to do this.

## I am not a developer, can I still contribute?
Yes. You can still submit design proposals through [issues](https://github.com/dmitrizzle/Analog.Cafe/issues) if you are a designer. Or, if you are a photographer, writer or a creative-type, feel free to submit your work to the first Analog.Cafe publication dedicated to film photography (which happens to be hosted on [Analog.Cafe](https://analog.cafe) url).
