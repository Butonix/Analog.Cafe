		<h2>Animation & I</h2>
		<p>Before I got involved with making websites and even photography animation was my primary method of expression. Back in the 90's my elementary school friends and I got pirated copies of 3D Studio MAX to play with. Back then computers were a novelty so just seeing things move on a screen was cool as fuck. Everything we created was obviously garbage but this process started an itch. An itch to create and experiment that made me the man I am today.</p>

Most of the time I just wanted to speak and understand proper English and fit in somehow. Later I decided that I wanted to pick up chicks, so skateboarding and electric guitars took over.</p>
